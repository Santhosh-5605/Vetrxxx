                    <p><strong>What is Foot and Mouth Disease?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease affecting cloven-hoofed animals, including cattle. It causes fever, blister-like sores in the mouth and hooves, and can lead to severe economic losses in the livestock industry.
