                    <p><strong>What is Caseous Lymphadenitis (CL)?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Caseous Lymphadenitis (CL) is a chronic bacterial infection caused by <em>Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis</em>. It leads to abscess formation in the lymph nodes and internal organs, significantly affecting goat health and productivity.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Symptoms of CL in Goats:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enlarged, abscessed lymph nodes</li>
                        <li>Thick, pus-filled abscesses that may rupture</li>
                        <li>Weight loss and reduced milk production</li>
                        <li>Chronic cough if internal lymph nodes are affected</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bacteria entering through wounds or broken skin</li>
                        <li>Contaminated equipment, feeders, or bedding</li>
                        <li>Direct contact with infected goats</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Treatment and Prevention:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        There is no effective cure for CL, but managing outbreaks includes isolating infected animals, lancing and disinfecting abscesses, and using antibiotics under veterinary supervision. Prevention involves strict biosecurity measures, disinfecting tools, and culling severely affected animals to prevent the disease's spread.
