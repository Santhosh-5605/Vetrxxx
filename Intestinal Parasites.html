                    <p><strong>What are Intestinal Parasites?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Intestinal parasites are a common health issue in hens.
                         These parasites, including roundworms, tapeworms, and coccidia, live in the digestive system and cause a range of symptoms such as poor egg production, weight loss, and diarrhea.

                        <li>Contact with infected feces or other hens</li>
                        <li>Dirty or poorly maintained living environments</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Treatment and Prevention:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Treatment involves using dewormers or anti-parasitic medications that are specifically designed for poultry. It's also essential to keep the living environment clean and dry to prevent re-infestation. Regularly inspecting hens for signs of infection and maintaining good hygiene practices can help prevent intestinal parasite infestations.
