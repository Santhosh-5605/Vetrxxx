                    <p><strong>What are Fleas and Ticks?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Fleas and ticks are external parasites that can infest hens, causing discomfort, irritation, and sometimes serious health problems.
                        Fleas are small, wingless insects that feed on the blood of animals, while ticks are arachnids that also feed on blood and can transmit diseases.

                        Treatment involves removing the fleas and ticks from the hen using insecticidal shampoos or powders specifically designed for poultry. It's also essential to treat the environment by cleaning the coop thoroughly and using insecticides to eliminate any parasites present. Preventative measures include maintaining a clean and dry environment, using natural deterrents like diatomaceous earth, and regularly inspecting hens for pests.
