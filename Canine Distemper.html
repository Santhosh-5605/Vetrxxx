                    <p><strong>What is Canine Distemper?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Canine distemper is a highly contagious viral disease that affects dogs, caused by the canine distemper virus (CDV). It primarily affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems and can be fatal if left untreated.
