                    <p><strong>What is Johne's Disease?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Johne's Disease, also known as paratuberculosis, is a chronic bacterial infection caused by <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> subspecies <em>paratuberculosis</em>. It primarily affects the intestines of cattle, leading to severe weight loss and diarrhea.

                        There is no effective cure for Johne's Disease. Prevention focuses on herd management, testing, culling infected animals, and maintaining strict sanitation practices. Controlling the spread requires preventing newborn calves from exposure to contaminated environments and infected adult animals.
