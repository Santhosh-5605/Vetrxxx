                    <p><strong>What is Respiratory Infection?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Respiratory infections are one of the most common health issues for hens. These infections can be caused by a variety of viruses, bacteria, or environmental factors. 
                        Symptoms include coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and labored breathing. Infected hens may become lethargic and have a reduced appetite.

                    <p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Viral infections (e.g., avian influenza)</li>
                        <li>Bacterial infections (e.g., Mycoplasma)</li>
                        <li>Dusty or poorly ventilated environments</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Treatment:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Bacterial infections may require antibiotics, while viral infections are more challenging to treat. 
                        It's essential to isolate affected birds to prevent the spread of infection and maintain good hygiene in the henhouse.
