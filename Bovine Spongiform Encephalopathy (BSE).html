                    <p><strong>What is Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as "mad cow disease," is a fatal neurodegenerative disease in cattle caused by abnormal prion proteins. It affects the brain and nervous system, leading to severe neurological symptoms.

                    <p><strong>Symptoms of BSE in Cows:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Changes in behavior, such as nervousness or aggression</li>
                        <li>Loss of coordination and difficulty walking</li>
                        <li>Decreased milk production</li>
                        <li>Weight loss despite a normal appetite</li>
                        <li>Progressive deterioration leading to paralysis</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consumption of contaminated animal feed containing infected meat and bone meal</li>
                        <li>Spread through exposure to infected brain or spinal tissue</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Treatment and Prevention:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        There is no cure for BSE, and infected cattle must be culled to prevent the spread. Preventative measures include banning the use of animal by-products in cattle feed, strict surveillance programs, and ensuring proper feed regulations to minimize exposure to prion-infected material.
