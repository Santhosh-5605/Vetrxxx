                    <p><strong>What is Feline HIV (FIV)?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), often referred to as Feline HIV, is a viral infection that weakens a cat's immune system. It is similar to HIV in humans, but it cannot be transmitted to humans. Cats infected with FIV are more susceptible to other infections, but the virus itself is not usually fatal.

                    <p><strong>Symptoms of Feline HIV (FIV) in Cats:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Frequent fever</li>
                        <li>Pale gums and mouth ulcers</li>
                        <li>Weight loss and poor coat condition</li>
                        <li>Chronic infections (skin, respiratory, and urinary infections)</li>
                        <li>Behavioral changes (e.g., aggression or lethargy)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bitten during a fight with an infected cat (most common route of transmission)</li>
                        <li>Mother-to-kitten transmission during birth or nursing</li>
                        <li>Less commonly, through mating with an infected cat</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Treatment and Prevention:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        There is no cure for FIV, but cats can live a long and healthy life with proper care. Treatment generally focuses on managing symptoms and preventing secondary infections. This can include antibiotics for infections, pain management, and regular vet check-ups. Keeping infected cats indoors to prevent the spread of the virus and protecting them from other infectious diseases is recommended.
