                    <p><strong>What is Scrapie?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Scrapie is a fatal, degenerative disease affecting the nervous system of goats and sheep. It is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) and is caused by abnormal prion proteins.

                    <p><strong>Symptoms of Scrapie in Goats:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Excessive itching and rubbing</li>
                        <li>Loss of coordination and difficulty walking</li>
                        <li>Behavioral changes such as aggression or nervousness</li>
                        <li>Weight loss despite a normal appetite</li>
                        <li>Progressive weakness leading to paralysis</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Transmission from infected mothers to kids through birth fluids</li>
                        <li>Exposure to contaminated environments or equipment</li>
                        <li>Genetic susceptibility to prion infection</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Treatment and Prevention:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        There is no cure for Scrapie, and affected goats must be euthanized to prevent the spread. Prevention strategies include genetic testing for resistance, strict biosecurity measures, and avoiding the introduction of infected animals into the herd. Regular monitoring and government surveillance programs help control the disease.
