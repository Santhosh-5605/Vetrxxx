                    <p><strong>What is Feline Leukemia?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) is a viral infection that affects cats and can lead to severe health problems, including immune system suppression, anemia, and certain types of cancer. It is a major cause of death in cats, particularly those that are not vaccinated against the disease.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact with infected cats, especially through saliva, urine, and feces</li>
                        <li>Close contact with an infected cat during grooming, fighting, or sharing food bowls</li>
                        <li>Mother-to-kitten transmission during pregnancy or birth</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Treatment and Prevention:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        There is no cure for Feline Leukemia, but cats diagnosed with FeLV can live longer with supportive care. This may include managing secondary infections, providing immune support, and offering a nutritious diet. Prevention is best achieved through vaccination, avoiding contact with infected cats, and keeping infected cats indoors to prevent the spread of the virus.
