                    <p><strong>What is Johne's Disease?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Johne's Disease, also known as Paratuberculosis, is a contagious and chronic bacterial infection caused by <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> subspecies <em>paratuberculosis</em> (MAP). It affects the intestinal tract of goats, leading to severe weight loss and diarrhea.

                    <p><strong>Symptoms of Johne's Disease in Goats:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Chronic weight loss despite a good appetite</li>
                        <li>Diarrhea (less common in goats than in cattle)</li>
                        <li>Weakness and reduced milk production</li>
                        <li>Rough coat and general poor body condition</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ingestion of contaminated food, water, or milk</li>
                        <li>Exposure to feces of infected goats</li>
                        <li>Transmission from mother to kid through colostrum or milk</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Treatment and Prevention:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        There is no effective cure for Johne's Disease. Control measures include testing and culling infected animals, maintaining strict hygiene practices, and preventing young goats from exposure to contaminated environments. Herd management and biosecurity measures play a crucial role in reducing the spread of the disease.
