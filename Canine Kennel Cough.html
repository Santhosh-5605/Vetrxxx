                    <p><strong>What is Canine Kennel Cough?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Canine Kennel Cough, also known as infectious tracheobronchitis, is a highly contagious respiratory disease in dogs. It is caused by a combination of viruses and bacteria, including the canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. The disease is characterized by a dry, hacking cough, and it is most commonly spread in environments where dogs are in close contact, such as kennels or dog parks.

                        <li>Weak immune systems, especially in puppies and older dogs</li>
                        <li>Infection with a combination of bacteria and viruses, particularly Bordetella bronchiseptica</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Treatment and Prevention:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Treatment for kennel cough typically involves antibiotics if a bacterial infection is present, along with medications to relieve symptoms like coughing. Most cases of kennel cough are mild and resolve on their own, but severe cases may require additional medical care. Prevention includes vaccination against Bordetella bronchiseptica and avoiding high-risk areas, such as crowded kennels or dog parks. Keeping your dogâ€™s immune system strong through proper nutrition and regular veterinary care can also help prevent the disease.
