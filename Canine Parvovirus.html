                    <p><strong>What is Canine Parvovirus?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a highly contagious viral disease that primarily affects puppies and unvaccinated dogs. The virus attacks the gastrointestinal system, leading to severe vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. If untreated, it can be fatal.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Symptoms of Canine Parvovirus in Dogs:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Severe vomiting and diarrhea (often bloody)</li>
                        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                        <li>Fever</li>
                        <li>Severe dehydration</li>
                        <li>Lethargy and weakness</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Infection with the canine parvovirus (CPV)</li>
                        <li>Exposure to infected dogs or contaminated environments (e.g., kennels)</li>
                        <li>Puppies are at the highest risk, especially those that are not vaccinated</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Treatment and Prevention:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Treatment for parvovirus involves hospitalization for intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration and medications to control vomiting and diarrhea. There is no specific antiviral treatment for CPV, so supportive care is essential. Prevention is key, and vaccination is the most effective way to protect dogs from parvovirus.
