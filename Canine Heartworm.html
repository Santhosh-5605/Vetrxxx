                    <p><strong>What is Canine Heartworm?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Canine heartworm disease is a serious and potentially fatal condition caused by foot-long worms called heartworms (*Dirofilaria immitis*) that live in the heart, lungs, and blood vessels of infected dogs. The disease is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito and can lead to severe heart and lung damage if left untreated.

                    <p><strong>Symptoms of Canine Heartworm in Dogs:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Coughing, especially during exercise or at night</li>
                        <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
                        <li>Weight loss and loss of appetite</li>
                        <li>Difficulty breathing and rapid breathing</li>
                        <li>Swollen abdomen (in advanced cases)</li>
                        <li>Collapse (in severe cases)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Infection through the bite of a mosquito carrying the heartworm larvae</li>
                        <li>Lack of preventative heartworm medications</li>
                        <li>Exposure to areas with high mosquito populations, especially in warm and humid climates</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Treatment and Prevention:</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Treatment for heartworm disease typically involves medications that kill the adult heartworms and larvae. However, treatment can be expensive and risky, especially for dogs with advanced disease. Prevention is much more effective and involves administering monthly heartworm preventatives in the form of pills, chewables, or injections. Regular veterinary check-ups, including blood tests to detect heartworm, are essential for early detection and prevention.
